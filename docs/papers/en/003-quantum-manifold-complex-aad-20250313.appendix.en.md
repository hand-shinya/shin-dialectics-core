# Purpose
This appendix adds **explicit lists** so that the English corpus captures not only the prose but also the **novel contributions, precise prompt templates, and math–prompt correspondences** stated or implied in the Japanese original.

## A. Novel Contributions (Authorial Claims)
- **N1. Triadic coupling**: AAD explicitly couples **quantum theory**, **manifold geometry**, and **complex-systems dynamics** as *operational* models of dialectical motion.
- **N2. Operationalization via prompts**: Each mathematical element is implemented as prompt operators and sequence rules (observation-axes, order-effects, interference, transforms, curvature, criticality).
- **N3. Superposed reasoning**: Maintain parallel theses/antitheses and reason *inside the superposition* (not only after collapse).
- **N4. Manifold-of-perspectives**: Viewpoints as local coordinates; **transforms** + **geodesics** produce integrative paths; **curvature** marks creative-tension zones.
- **N5. Nonlinear emergence**: Use **critical points** and **bifurcations** to explain qualitative leaps ("negation of the negation") and emergent orders.
- **N6. Wave-functional reporting**: Final answers are distributions with conditions/limits, followed by **adversarial verification**.
- **N7. Human-in-the-loop**: Human judgment selects axes, adversarial tests, and adoption criteria; AI supplies enumerations, frame flips, and rapid counterexamples.

## B. Core Definitions (Working)
- **Observation axes (Ω)**: time / space / value / subject / negation types ([i]/[e]/double) and meta-axes.  
- **Meta-operations**: `abstract_projection`, `logic_flip`, `pattern_rupture`, `semantic_fission`, `meta_triggering`.  
- **Thresholds**: λₐ (negation depth), λₛ (integration strength), with progress logging.

## C. Prompt Templates (Copy-Paste Ready)
### C1. Quantum Dialectics (superposition/interference/collapse)
```
Theme = <your theme>
Axes  = {time, space, agent}

1) Give 3 simultaneous interpretations (superposed theses) of Theme.
2) For each, generate antitheses along Axes (internal [i], external [e], and double).
3) Propose 3 probabilistic syntheses with explicit conditions and limits.
4) Analyze interference patterns among the syntheses and present a final wave-functional view.
5) Adversarial check: provide the strongest counterevidence and update the distribution if needed.
```

### C2. Manifold Thinking (coordinates/transforms/geodesics/curvature)
```
1) Define 8 local coordinate systems (viewpoints) for Theme and state each local truth.
2) Identify transforms between systems; specify what information is lost or gained by each transform.
3) Compute geodesic-like integration paths across systems (justify why they are optimal).
4) Mark high-curvature regions (creative tension) and opportunities.
5) Close the loop once (holonomy-like): explain what changed after a full circuit (negation of negation).
```

### C3. Complex-Systems Dynamics (criticality/bifurcation/emergence)
```
1) List key state variables and parameters for Theme.
2) Identify attractors and potential chaotic regimes.
3) Locate critical points and expected bifurcations; specify early-warning indicators.
4) Simulate parameter changes and describe qualitative regime shifts.
5) Propose emergent orders and transition strategies post-bifurcation.
6) State residual risks and monitoring rules.
```

### C4. Integrated AAD (8-step unified protocol)
```
1) Clarify Theme + explicit assumptions.
2) Generate 3–5 strong antitheses (cover [i]/[e]/double).
3) Build superposed theses and choose observation axes.
4) Run manifold mapping (coords, transforms, geodesics, curvature).
5) Explore complex-system dynamics (criticality, bifurcation, emergence).
6) Produce probabilistic syntheses and a wave-functional report.
7) Adversarial verification; update thresholds (e.g., λₐ, λₛ) and log Σ-stages.
8) Final (provisional) consolidation + next-iteration triggers.
```

## D. Math → Prompt Mapping (Concise Table)
- **Superposition** → hold competing interpretations simultaneously; reason before collapse.  
- **Interference** → analyze cross-effects between syntheses; explain leaps.  
- **Operator non-commutativity** → order-effects in questioning; vary sequence and compare.  
- **Basis choice** → select observation axes; report sensitivity.  
- **Manifold transforms** → translate results between viewpoints; log information distortion.  
- **Geodesics** → justify minimal-loss integration paths.  
- **Curvature** → mark creative-tension zones (★).  
- **Critical parameters** → track regime shifts and emergent orders.
