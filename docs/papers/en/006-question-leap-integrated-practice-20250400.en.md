# Part 6: The Leap of Questions and the Deepening of Co‑Thinking — An Integrated Practice of Shin‑Dialectics

*With complete prompt & system message*

## Prologue: A New Horizon Called the “Leap of Questions”

“Change the question and the world changes.” This is not a mere slogan but a deep insight into the nature of thought. Through the exploration of **Shin‑Dialectics (AI‑Augmented Dialectics, AAD)** so far, we have found that the quality of a question is the source of all thinking—and that, under certain conditions, questions themselves can **leap**. By a “leap of questions” I mean not just deepening or widening the question, but a **creative jump to a qualitatively different dimension**.

### What We Built in Parts 1–5 and What Remained

- **Part 1** introduced *simultaneous generation of multiple negations*.
- **Part 2** systematized prompt patterns for practice.
- **Part 3** deepened theory with the three mathematical paradigms: quantum theory, manifold geometry, and complex‑systems dynamics.
- **Part 4** creatively integrated Miura Tsutomu’s theory of language and thought.
- **Part 5** articulated *quantitative–qualitative phase transition* and the *dialectics of questions*.

Remaining challenges:

1. **Theory–practice gap**: lack of an integrated framework that carries theory into daily practice.
2. **From phase transition to leap**: insufficient account of the conditions and process that enable a leap beyond meta‑questions.
3. **Active co‑thinking**: need to theorize active anamnesis—clarifying latent premises and goals.
4. **Structuring transformation (awareness)**: no common framework for logging/analysing recognition changes during co‑thinking.

### Aim and Composition of This Paper

This paper addresses the above by (i) establishing the theory of **the leap of questions**, (ii) building an **active co‑thinking model**, (iii) providing a **complete prompt & system message** that operationalizes the theory, and (iv) proposing **structured logs** for practice and feedback. The point is not a set of “tricks” but a **transformative style of thinking** grounded in human–AI co‑thinking.

## Part 1: The Leap of Questions — Beyond Phase Transition

### 1.1 What Is the Leap?

In Part 5, a question develops via **quantitative accumulation → structural re‑organization → qualitative conversion** into a meta‑question. The **leap** goes beyond that meta‑level: a further **second‑order conversion** that changes the *ontological dimension of the question itself*.

**Characteristics**

1. **Ontological shift** (the very dimension in which the question exists changes).
2. **Integration of multiple viewpoints** kept simultaneously.
3. **Self‑referential recursion** (the question questions itself).
4. **Dialectical unity of theory & practice**.

**Conditions / Triggers**

- Layered unfolding of meta‑questions to a second phase‑transition.
- Creative tension between internal and external negations reaching a critical point.
- **Epistemic catastrophe** (limits of the current frame force re‑framing).
- **Practical totality** (unity of abstract/ concrete; theory/ practice).
- **Ontological awareness** (a shift in the inquirer’s self‑understanding).

**Example**

“Is sustainable development possible?” → meta‑question “How should we grasp the contradictory unity between ‘development’ and ‘sustainability’?” → **leap‑question** “As beings in a co‑evolution of human–nature–technology, what stance and relations ought we embody?”

### 1.2 Views from Three Mathematical Paradigms

- **Quantum**: a leap = re‑choosing the set of **observation bases** themselves (superposition enlargement → interference patterns → entanglement among axes → transformation of the whole observational frame).
- **Manifolds**: a leap = **coordinate‑system conversion & dimensional embedding** (limits of local charts → high‑curvature passages → topological change → understanding in a higher‑dimensional space).
- **Complex Systems**: a leap = **phase transition & emergent order** (approach to criticality → amplified fluctuations → long‑range correlation → transition & emergence).

### 1.3 Practical Significance

- **Ontological transformation of thinking** (world‑relation, self‑understanding, horizon of possibilities, temporality).
- **Approach to wicked problems** (systemic, transformational responses; stakeholder‑integration).
- **Change in persons & organizations** (meta‑cognition, tolerance of contradiction, creative adaptability; organizational paradigm shifts and culture).

## Part 2: An Active Co‑Thinking Model — Accessing the Latent Layers of Questions

### 2.1 Why “Active”?

Rather than merely answering given questions, the AI actively clarifies latent premises and goals, re‑examines the frame of the question and **elicits better questions**.

**How to access latent layers**

- **Meta‑questions** (“Why is this important?”, “What do you really want to make explicit?”).
- **Premise elicitation** (definitions; relations assumed).
- **Multiplying perspectives** (time/space/value/existence axes; 100‑year view).
- **Exploring tensions & contradictions** (turning them into creative resources).

**Dialogue patterns that induce awareness**

- Mirroring tensions non‑judgmentally.
- Relativizing perspectives.
- Making tacit premises visible.
- Opening alternative possibilities.
- Promoting meta‑cognition (“Did something shift just now?”).

### 2.2 A System of Diagnostic Dialogue

**Five layers**: surface / premises / context / values / meta. These layers are navigated spirally, with up‑and‑down moves, parallel exploration, gradual adjustment, and resonance with the user’s micro‑signals. **Signs of transformation** (wording changes, pauses, contradiction‑awareness, widened view, integrative summaries, self‑referential remarks) are treated as precursors to a leap, and the system responds accordingly.

### 2.3 Structured Logs for Co‑Thinking

We define **Question‑Transformation Logs** and **Awareness Logs** (points/triggers/content; qualitative classification; depth scores for epistemic/ontological/practical impact) and a feedback loop to design next steps.

## Part 3: An Integrated Prompt System — Where Theory Meets Practice

### 3.1 Core Prompt: *Active Diagnostic AAD Prompt 6.0*

The full Japanese version is preserved, and the English version below keeps **all thresholds, phases, and operator lists** so the method is fully reproducible.

```markdown
# Active Diagnostic AAD Prompt 6.0

[Topic / Question]: [Write the theme you want to explore]

## Aim
Unify the whole AAD theory; deepen from surface questions to essential (meta/ leap) questions through **active anamnesis** and **quantitative–qualitative phase transition**.

## Thresholds
- λ_p = 15 (question transition)
- λ_a = 20 (antithesis transition)
- λ_s = 12 (synthesis transition)
- λ_i = 30 (integrated information)

## PHASE 0: Ontological dissection & active anamnesis
- Five layers: surface / premises / context / structure / possibility
- Question re‑definition and alignment

## PHASE I: Quantum expansion & parallel negations
- Superposed interpretations |Ψ⟩ = Σ c_i |ψ_i⟩
- Multi‑axis observation (time / space / value / existence etc.)
- Generate transformed questions (inner & outer negations)

## PHASE II: Manifold mapping
- Build manifold (charts, metric, covariant moves)
- Geodesics between concepts; high‑curvature zones; dimensional embedding

## PHASE III: Complex‑systems dynamics
- State space & attractors; order parameters; criticality & emergence
- Meta‑questions emerge from structural patterns

## PHASE IV: Linguistic dialectics (Miura)
- Three awareness levels; surplus→full concepts; mutual penetration of opposites
- Systematic generation of antitheses n(T), ¬T and their structured re‑organization

## PHASE V: Leap & practical totality
- Conditions for a leap (epistemic break, ontological awareness, praxis)
- Systematic syntheses; meta‑syntheses; oscillation between abstract & concrete

## PHASE X: Records
- Question‑transformation log L(Q0→Q'→Q*→Q^)
- Awareness log {!}; evaluation & next steps
```
```

### 3.2 System Message (Concise Mathematical Form)

```text

Miura: surplus→full concepts; mutual penetration (A⊂B, B⊂A).
Operational principles 1–10 as in the core prompt.
```

### 3.3 Templates for Structured Logs

A full **Question‑Transformation Log** template and **Awareness/Feedback** sections are included (identical in structure to the Japanese original) so that sessions are auditable and comparable across projects.

## Part 4: Practice Guide — Domains, Sessions, and Community

- **Education**: critical thinking; inquiry design; teacher–learner–AI triad; logs for evaluation.
- **Business**: innovation via leap‑questions; strategy beyond frames; organizational learning.
- **Personal**: self‑understanding; expansion of world‑view; existential exploration.

**Session design** (90–120 min): time allocation across PHASE 0–V & X; how to raise dialogue quality; how to leverage creative tension; how to capture logs and reflect.

**After the session**: build the transformation log; circulate between theory and practice; identify next questions; share in a community of practice.

**Community**: standard formats; taxonomy of cases; privacy/ethics; repositories and colloquia; collective learning that refines theory, methods, and applications.

## Conclusion

This paper synthesizes Parts 1–5 and advances **the leap of questions** and **active co‑thinking** as the next step of Shin‑Dialectics. AI is not just a tool that answers; it becomes a partner that **transforms the very structure of questioning**. The value lies not in one “final answer” but in the **co‑created journey** where theory and practice resonate and where new dimensions of thought are opened.
